## 9. PALLINDROME NUMBER

### Description:
- Given an integers `x`.
-  requirement: Return true if `x` is pallindrome else return false

#### Examples:

```
    Input: x = 121
    Output: true
    Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

    Input: x = -121
    Output: false
    Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
    
    Input: x = 10
    Output: false
    Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

```

#### Solutions:

- `Reversing the entire number:` using while()

    ```py
        class Solution:
            def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
                temp = x
                rev = 0
                while(temp > 0):
                    rev = rev * 10 + temp % 10
                    temp = temp//10

                return rev == x
    ```
- `Using built-in method:` reversed()
    ```py
        class Solution:
            def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
                rev = ''.join(reversed(str(x)))
                return rev == str(x)
    ```
