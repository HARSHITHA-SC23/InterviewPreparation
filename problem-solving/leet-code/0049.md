## 49. GROUP ANAGRAMS

### Description:
-  given `strs`: array of strings
-  requirement: group the `anagram` together and return the answer
-  explanation: `anagram` is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of the orginal word or phrase

#### Examples:

```
    Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
    Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

    Input: strs = [""]
    Output: [[""]]
    
    Input: strs = ["a"]
    Output: [["a"]]

```

#### Solutions:

- `Using Hashmap and sorted:`
    - create an empty hashmap/dictionary.
    - Empty result array which we append at the last
    - Check if the letter of the element is already a key in the hashmap
        - if it is a key then added it that key
        - else create a new key and add
    - To compare the keys:
        - first we start with loop to go through each value in an array
        - then we will sort using sorted, it returns list of letters.
        - Since list is muttable convert it to immutable which is tuple
        - anagram[sorted_s].append(s) => This line does the work 
        - it says for the sorted tuple which is a key add the orignal string as a value 
    
    ```py
        from collections import defaultdict

        class Solution:
            def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
                anagram = defaultdict(list)
                result = []

                for s in strs:
                    sorted_s = tuple(sorted(s))
                    anagram[sorted_s].append(s)
                
                for values in anagram.values():
                    result.append(values)
                return result  
    ```
