# This document contains all the coding problems and important topics on Stack

## Important question

1. What is stack?
    - A stack is a linear data structure which follows LIFO principle i.e., Lats-In-First-Out.
    - The element is added and remove only from one end i.e., `top`.
2. How can we implement a stack?
    - Stack can be implemented using lists.
3. What are the main operations supported by stack?
    - Push: add an element to the top of the stack
    - Pop: removes an element from the top of the stack
    - Peek( or Top): Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
    - isEmpty: checks if the stack is empty
    - size: returns the length of the stack.
4. What is the time complexity of main stack operations?
    - It is O(1)
5. Can we implement a stack using linked list?
    - Yes, stack can be implemented using Lined list. where each node represents single element in the stack.
6. What is the significance of LIFO principle?
    - LIFO principle ensures that the most recently added element is the first removed.
    - example use case: function call stack, expression evaluation etc
7. How do you reverse a list using a stack in Python?
    - You can reverse a list using a stack by pushing all elements of the list onto the stack and then popping them back into a new list. - The popped elements will be in reverse order.
8. What is stcak overflow?
    - A stack overflow occurs when a program tries to push more elements onto the stack than it has space for.
9. How can a stack be used to implement function calls in programming languages?
    - A stack is used to store information about the active function calls in a program.
    - When a function is called, its context (such as local variables and return address) is pushed onto the stack.
    - When the function returns, its context is popped from the stack, and control is returned to the calling function.
10. What is the minimum number of stacks required to implement a queue?
    - Two: enqueue and dequeue
11. How do you implement a queue using two stacks in Python?
    - To implement a queue using two stacks in Python, you can use one stack for the enqueue operation and another for the dequeue operation.
    - When the dequeue stack is empty, you can transfer elements from the enqueue stack to the dequeue stack to perform the dequeue operation efficiently.
12. Can you implement a stack using a queue?
    - Yes, you can implement a stack using a queue.
    - One way to do this is to use two queues. One queue is used for the push operation, and the other queue is used for the pop operation.
    - The push operation can be simulated by enqueueing the new element and then dequeuing and enqueueing all other elements from the first queue to the second queue.
    - The pop operation can then be simulated by dequeuing the element from the second queue.
