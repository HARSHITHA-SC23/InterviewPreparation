## Understanding Data-structures and their Importance

- DSA plays a vital role in computer science and solving complex problem efficiency.
- Data structures refers to organize and manage data in a way that enbles effiicient access and modification.
- Algorithm are the step-by-step procedure design to solve specific problems.
- The importance of DSA are:
    - Optimization: It helps to optimized the speed and memory usage performance by choosing a right dsa for a given problem.
    - Resource utilization: Proper usage of memory and processing power
    - Scalability: with a proper utilization of DSA complex operations on large dataset can be performed without sacrificing the performance.
- DSA roadmap:
