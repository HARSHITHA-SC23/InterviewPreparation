# This document contains all the coding problems and important topics on Set

## Important question

1. What is a set in python?
    - A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. It means the order of the element doesn't matter.
    - It is defined by enclosing comma-seperated sequence of items inside a `{}` or `set()`.
    - Sets are mutable data structure, it means we can add or remove elements from them.
2. What is the difference between a set and a list in Python?
    - A set contains unique elements whereas list can contain duplicate elements.
    - In set order of the element doesn't matters but in list it maintains the order.
3. How to add element to a set?
    - Using `add()` method.
4. How do you remove elements from set?
    - Using `remove()` or `discard()` method.
    - remove() vs discard(): 
        - Both the methods remove element from the set.
        - The key differnce is if the element is not present in the set `remove()` throws `KeyError`, whereas `discard()` does nothing.
5. What are the common set operations?
    - Union: union()
    - intersection: intersection()
    - difference: difference()
    - symmetric difference: symmetric_difference()
6. How to check whether the element is present in set or not?
    - Using `in` operator
7. what is frozenset in python?
    - fronzenset is an immutable version of set.
    - Once the frozenset is created, it elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.
    - frozenset can be created using `frozenset(set)`.
8. How to convert list to set or vice versa?
    - Using `set()` method or `list()` metjod.
9. How to iterate a set?
    - Using loop
10. what is the Time complextity of the set?
    - Adding/removing element: O(1)
    - worst case: O(n)
