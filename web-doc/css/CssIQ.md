    |--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
    | Layout Model       | One-dimensional layout model, used for laying out items in a single direction (row or column). | Two-dimensional layout model, used for creating grid-based layouts with rows and columns. |
    | Axis               | Has a main axis and a cross axis. Items are laid out along the main axis and can be aligned along the cross axis. | Has both row and column axes, allowing for more complex layouts with rows and columns. Items can be aligned along both axes. |
    | Alignment          | Uses properties like `justify-content` and `align-items` to align items along the main and cross axes respectively. | Uses properties like `justify-items`, `align-items`, `justify-content`, and `align-content` for alignment, providing more control over both axes. |
    | Spacing            | Provides limited control over spacing between items. You can use properties like `justify-content: space-between` or `margin` for spacing. | Provides more control over spacing between rows and columns using properties like `grid-gap`, `row-gap`, and `column-gap`, allowing for precise spacing in grid layouts. |
    | Use Cases          | Best suited for simpler layouts where items need to be flexibly sized and aligned along a single axis, such as navigation menus or card layouts. | Ideal for more complex layouts with multiple rows and columns, such as website layouts, forms, or dashboard designs. Provides greater flexibility and control over the layout. |
