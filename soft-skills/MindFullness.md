1. **Understand Time and Space Complexity**:
   - Learn how to calculate time and space complexity for algorithms.

2. **LeetCode Problem Solving**:
   - Easy to medium problems should be attempted within specific time limits.
   - Initially, try to solve a problem within 45 minutes. If unsuccessful, read the solution, understand the concept, and try again.
   - For the next 10 days, aim to solve a problem within 30 minutes.
   - Afterward, aim to solve a problem within 20 minutes.

3. **Problem Solving Approach**:
   - Understand the question and state your understanding and initial approach.
   - Explain each step while coding.
   - After using a naive approach, try to optimize the solution. If unsure how to optimize, read blogs and different solutions.

4. **Mistakes to Avoid**:
   - Prefer Python over C++, C, and Java.
   - Solve problems in a structured manner, not randomly.
   - If unable to solve a problem within 45-60 minutes, seek help and avoid wasting too much time.
   - Review previous problems and try to optimize solutions if necessary.
